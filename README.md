Welcome to the StarSeed project.
https://github.com/NewSpaceNYC/starseed.git

A project that aims to ....
be a whitelabel assmebly.com (for all types of projects that can effectively leverage bounties)
no lock in... etc... check this document for high level outline: http://goo.gl/WTH2tm

# TODO 
#  setup models (in progress)

#  get some static files uploaded
#  define scope

#  look to https://github.com/assemblymade/meta for inspiration
#  start from scratch, build the best features
#  we have some ideas will share
#  today we'll focus on defining the scope of the project and get some models / views coded
#  define code tasks we can work on
#  we may not need the website app. and use starseed "app"
----
#  create a logo (done)
#  lets create an application (done) sort of... we're using the startseed app:


You may also want to follow the Django tutorial to create your first application:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/

# future plans
# livecoding_stream :) (aka coderstream.tv if they don't add delete 
# (and even then, probably anyways to make it open and as a Google Hangouts addon)
# machine learning stuff
# use slack as plugin for chat - yes

#for our version of live coding we can have a mobile app... can have bluetooth...
