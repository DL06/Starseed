# TODO 
#  create a logo
#  get some static files uploaded
#  define scope
#  setup models
#  look to https://github.com/assemblymade/meta for inspiration
#  start from scratch, build the best features
#  we have some ideas will share
#  today we'll focus on defining the scope of the project and get some models / views coded
#  define code tasks we can work on

#  lets create an application:
#  we may not need the website app. and use starseed "app"
